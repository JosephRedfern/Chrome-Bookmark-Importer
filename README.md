Chrome Bookmark Importer

The PHP Library I have used (PHP Simple HTML DOM Parses) is licensed under the MIT license.

This script takes in a html bookmark file exported by the Chromium/Google Chrome, and inserts the bookmarks into a MySQL Table.

The sql file has been provided for your convenience.
